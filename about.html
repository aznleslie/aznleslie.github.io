              <p> My name is Leslie Nguyen and I am currently an <em><strong>aspiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapist">Occupational Therapist.</em></strong></a>
                I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Houston where I double-majored in Kinesiology and Psychology.
                My goal in life is to become a pediatric occupational therapist where I will one day have the ability to open my own
                pediatric center and help the youth with the numerous obstacles they will face in their life. I believe that this is a very sensitive stage in one's life
                and treatment should focus on not only helping a to be able to function in their every day setting but also help children to create a confidence in themselves
                that they will be able to overcome anything and they are not different than other children but are stronger especially regarding the challenges they face in their lives.
